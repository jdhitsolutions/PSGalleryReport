## [FogApi](https://www.powershellgallery.com/Packages/FogApi/2409.9.4) | 2409.9.4

### Published: 09/04/2024 22:49:13 by JJ Fullmer

This module is used to easily run Fog API commands on your fogserver from a powershell console or script.
    This essentially gives you a crossplatform commandline interface for fog tasks and makes many things easier to automate.
    You can install FOG Project from https://github.com/FogProject/fogproject

    The documentation is hosted on readthedocs at https://fogapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

    To install this module you need at least powershell v3, was created with 5.1 and intended to be cross platform compatible with powershell v6
    To Install this module follow these steps
    
    * Easiest method: Install from PSGallery https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/FogApi `Install-Module -name fogApi` or `Install-PSResource -Name FogApi -TrustRepository -repository PSGallery`

    * Install with chocolatey (will install the module by copying the built version to the powershell core and windows powershell paths, will remove any existing versions)
    `choco upgrade fogapi -y`

    * Manual Method:
    * download the zip of this repo and extract it and use Import-Module on the extracted path

    The module is now installed.
    You can use Set-fogserverSettings to set your fogserver hostname and api keys.
    The first time you try to run a command the settings.json file will automatically open
    in notepad on windows, nano on linux, or TextEdit on Mac
    You can also open the settings.json file and edit it manually before running your first command.
    The default settings are explanations of where to find the proper settings since json can''t have comments

    Once the settings are set you can have a jolly good time utilzing the fog documentation
    found here https://news.fogproject.org/simplified-api-documentation/ that was used to model the parameters

    i.e.

    Get-FogObject has a type param that validates to object, objectactivetasktype, and search as those are the options given in the documentation.
    Each of those types validates (which means autocompletion) to the core types listed in the documentation.
    So if you typed in Get-FogObject -Type object -Object  h and then started hitting tab, it would loop through the possible core objects you can get from the api that start with ''h'' such as history, host, etc.

    Unless you filter a get with a json body it will return all the results into a powershell object. That object is easy to work with to create other commands. Note: Full Pipeline support will come at a later time
     i.e.

     hosts = Get-FogObject -Type Object -CoreObject Host # calls GET on {your-fog-server}/fog/host to list all hosts
     Now you can search all your hosts for the one or ones you''re looking for with powershell
     maybe you want to find all the hosts with ''IT'' in the name  (note ''?'' is an alias for Where-Object)
    ITHosts = hosts.hosts | ? name -match ''IT'';

    Now maybe you want to change the image all of these computers use to one named ''IT-Image''
    You can edit the object in powershell with a foreach-object (''%'' is an alias for foreach-object)
    updatedITHosts = ITHosts | % { _.imagename = ''IT-image''}

    Then you need to convert that object to json and pass each object into one api call at a time. Which sounds complicated, but it''s not, it''s as easy as
    
    updateITHosts | % {
        jsonData = _ | ConvertTo-Json;
        Update-FogObject -Type object -CoreObject host -objectID _.id -jsonData jsonData;
        #successful result of updated objects properties
        #or any error messages will output to screen for each object
    }
    
    This is just one small example of the limitless things you can do with the api and powershell objects.
