Execute commands like

Write-Log -message "Hello World"
Write-Log -message "Hello World" -severity ([LogSeverity]::ERROR)
"Hello World" | Write-Log

The logfile getting written looks like

20210217134552	a6f3eda5-1b50-4841-861e-010174784e8c	INFO	Hello World
20210217134617	a6f3eda5-1b50-4841-861e-010174784e8c	ERROR	Hello World

separated by tabs.

Make sure, the variables $logfile and $processId are present before calling this. Otherwise they will be created automatically and you are notified about the location and the current process id
The variables could be filled like

$logfile = ".\test.log"
$processId = [guid]::NewGuid()

The process id is good for parallel calls/processes so you know they belong together
