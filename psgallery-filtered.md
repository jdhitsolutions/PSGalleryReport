Harden Windows Safely, Securely, only with Official Microsoft methods - 🦄 Intune - 🧩 Group Policy - 🛡️ Local - ☁️ Cloud (All scenarios supported 💯)

⭕ This module provides 3 main features: Hardening, Auditing/checking the system compliance, and undoing the Hardening

⭕ Please read the GitHub's readme before running this module: https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security

💜 GUI (Graphical User Interface) is Available! Run (Protect-WindowsSecurity -GUI) to use the GUI instead of the CLI experience.

💠 Features of this module:

  ✅ Everything always stays up-to-date with the newest proactive security measures that are industry standards and scalable.
  ✅ Everything is in plain text, nothing hidden, no 3rd party executable or pre-compiled binary is involved.
  ✅ No Windows functionality is removed/disabled against Microsoft's recommendations.
  ✅ The module primarily uses Group policies, the Microsoft recommended way of configuring Windows. It also uses PowerShell cmdlets where Group Policies aren't available, and finally uses a few registry keys to configure security measures that can neither be configured using Group Policies nor PowerShell cmdlets. This is why the module doesn't break anything or cause unwanted behavior.
  ✅ When a hardening measure is no longer necessary because it's applied by default by Microsoft on new builds of Windows, it will also be removed from the module in order to prevent any problems and because it won't be necessary anymore.
  ✅ The module can be run infinite number of times, it's made in a way that it won't make any duplicate changes.
  ✅ The module prompts for confirmation before running each hardening category.
  ✅ Applying these hardening measures makes your PC compliant with Microsoft Security Baselines and Secured-core PC specifications (provided that you use modern hardware that supports the latest Windows security features)

💠 Hardening Categories from top to bottom: (⬇️Detailed info about each of them at my Github⬇️)

⏹ Commands that require Administrator Privileges
  ✅ Microsoft Security Baselines
  ✅ Microsoft 365 Apps Security Baselines
  ✅ Microsoft Defender
  ✅ Attack surface reduction rules
  ✅ Bitlocker Settings
  ✅ TLS Security
  ✅ Lock Screen
  ✅ UAC (User Account Control)
  ✅ Windows Firewall
  ✅ Optional Windows Features
  ✅ Windows Networking
  ✅ Miscellaneous Configurations
  ✅ Windows Update Configurations
  ✅ Edge Browser Configurations
  ✅ Certificate Checking Commands
  ✅ Country IP Blocking
  ✅ Downloads Defense Measures
⏹ Commands that don't require Administrator Privileges
  ✅ Non-Admin Commands that only affect the current user and do not make machine-wide changes.


💎 This module has hybrid mode of operation. It can run Interactively and non-interactively (Silent/unattended mode). More info in the document: https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki/Harden%E2%80%90Windows%E2%80%90Security%E2%80%90Module

🏴 If you have any questions, requests, suggestions etc. about this module, please open a new Discussion or Issue on GitHub

🟡 The module generates a nice output on the screen as well as giving users an option to export the results in a CSV file.

## [FogApi](https://www.powershellgallery.com/Packages/FogApi/2408.9.3) | 2408.9.3

### Published: 08/30/2024 12:48:42 by JJ Fullmer

This module is used to easily run Fog API commands on your fogserver from a powershell console or script.
    This essentially gives you a crossplatform commandline interface for fog tasks and makes many things easier to automate.

    The documentation is hosted on readthedocs at https://fogapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

    To install this module you need at least powershell v3, was created with 5.1 and intended to be cross platform compatible with powershell v6
    To Install this module follow these steps
    * Easiest method: Install from PSGallery https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/FogApi Install-Module -name fogApi

    * Manual Method:
    * download the zip of this repo and extract it and use Import-Module on the extracted path

    The module is now installed.
    You can use Set-fogserverSettings to set your fogserver hostname and api keys.
    The first time you try to run a command the settings.json file will automatically open
    in notepad on windows, nano on linux, or TextEdit on Mac
    You can also open the settings.json file and edit it manually before running your first command.
    The default settings are explanations of where to find the proper settings since json can''t have comments

    Once the settings are set you can have a jolly good time utilzing the fog documentation
    found here https://news.fogproject.org/simplified-api-documentation/ that was used to model the parameters

    i.e.

    Get-FogObject has a type param that validates to object, objectactivetasktype, and search as those are the options given in the documentation.
    Each of those types validates (which means autocompletion) to the core types listed in the documentation.
    So if you typed in Get-FogObject -Type object -Object  h and then started hitting tab, it would loop through the possible core objects you can get from the api that start with ''h'' such as history, host, etc.

    Unless you filter a get with a json body it will return all the results into a powershell object. That object is easy to work with to create other commands. Note: Full Pipeline support will come at a later time
     i.e.

     hosts = Get-FogObject -Type Object -CoreObject Host # calls get on http://fog-server/fog/host to list all hosts
     Now you can search all your hosts for the one or ones you''re looking for with powershell
     maybe you want to find all the hosts with ''IT'' in the name  (note ''?'' is an alias for Where-Object)
    ITHosts = hosts.hosts | ? name -match ''IT'';

    Now maybe you want to change the image all of these computers use to one named ''IT-Image''
    You can edit the object in powershell with a foreach-object (''%'' is an alias for foreach-object)
    updatedITHosts = ITHosts | % { _.imagename = ''IT-image''}

    Then you need to convert that object to json and pass each object into one api call at a time. Which sounds complicated, but it''s not, it''s as easy as
    
    updateITHosts | % {
        jsonData = _ | ConvertTo-Json;
        Update-FogObject -Type object -CoreObject host -objectID _.id -jsonData jsonData;
        #successful result of updated objects properties
        #or any error messages will output to screen for each object
    }
    
    This is just one small example of the limitless things you can do with the api and powershell objects.

Prism is a PowerShell module manager inspired by NuGet. Run `prism install` in a source code repository, and Prism will
save private modules into a "PSModules" directory in that repository. Prism let's you:

* Package and deploy modules side-by-side with the app or tool that uses them without needing to install
modules globally ahead of time.
* Not worry about what modules are or aren't installed. Scripts can import and use modules from the "PSModules"
directory in the script's source code repository.
* Avoid comitting modules to the source code repository. Team members and build processes run `prism install` to
get modules installed.
