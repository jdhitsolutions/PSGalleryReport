* Package and deploy modules side-by-side with the app or tool that uses them without needing to install
modules globally ahead of time.
* Not worry about what modules are or aren't installed. Scripts can import and use modules from the "PSModules"
directory in the script's source code repository.
* Avoid comitting modules to the source code repository. Team members and build processes run `prism install` to
get modules installed.

# FOG Api Powershell Module

This is a powershell module to simplify the use of the Fog Project API.
This module is used to easily run Fog API commands on your fogserver from a powershell console or script.
FOG is an opensource tool for imaging comptuters, this module uses the API on your internal fog server to 
perform almost any operation you can do in the GUI of Fog and provides you with the ability to extend things further.
It can be used to create more automation or to simply have a command line method of controlling fog operations.
This essentially gives you a crossplatform commandline interface for fog tasks and makes many things easier to automate.

Docs for this module can be found at https://fogapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

For more information about FOG see

# Versioning

The versioning of this module follows this pattern

`{Year|Month}.{Major Version}.{Revision #}`

See https://github.com/darksidemilk/FogApi?tab=readme-ov-file#versioning for more info

# Usage

You can use Set-fogserverSettings to set your fogserver hostname and api keys.
Or, the first time you try to run a command the settings.json file will automatically open in an OS Specific editor.
You can also open the settings.json file and edit it manually before running your first command.
The default settings are explanations of where to find the proper settings since json cannot have comments

Once the settings are set you can utilze the fog documentation found here https://news.fogproject.org/simplified-api-documentation/ that was used to model the parameters for Get-FogObject, Update-FogObject, and Remove-FogObject.
You can also utilize simpler functions of common tasks, see the links below for more info.
