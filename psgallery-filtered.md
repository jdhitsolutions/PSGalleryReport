Querying SQL (SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSql, SQLite, & mySql) the PowerShell way: simple commands... powerful opportunities.

SimplySql is a module that provides an intuitive set of cmdlets for talking to databases that abstracts the vendor specifics, allowing you to focus on getting work done.  The basic pattern is to connect to a database, execute one or more sql statements and then close your database connection.  This module provides cmdlets that map to this basic pattern.  Each provider has its own Open-*Connection cmdlet -> Open-SqlConnection, Open-SQLiteConnection, Open-OracleConnection, Open-PostGreConnection, Open-MySqlConnection.  The rest of the commands are provider agnostic.

Open/Close/Show/Test/Set/Get -SqlConnection >> Control as many active connections as you want.
Invoke- SqlScalar/SqlQuery/SqlUpdate >> Interact with those connections.
Get/Clear -SqlMessage >> Get Informational messages, if provider supports it.
Invoke-SqlBulkCopy >> Bulk Dataload from one connection to another.
Start/Complete/Undo -SqlTransaction >> Utilize transactions!
