The AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell lets developers and administrators manage their AWS services from the Windows PowerShell scripting environment.
This version of AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell is compatible with Windows PowerShell 2-5.1. An alternative module, AWSPowerShell.NetCore, provides support for Windows PowerShell 3+ and PowerShell Core 6+ on Windows, Linux and macOS.
This product provides support for all AWS services in a single module. As an alternative, a modular variant is also available: separate smaller modules (e.g. AWS.Tools.EC2, AWS.Tools.S3...) allow managing each AWS Service.
