### Published: 12/22/2025 21:48:59 by Amazon.com Inc

The AWS Tools for PowerShell lets developers and administrators manage their AWS services from the PowerShell scripting environment.
This version of AWS Tools for PowerShell is compatible with Windows PowerShell 3+ and PowerShell Core 6+ on Windows, Linux and macOS. When running on Windows PowerShell, .NET Framework 4.7.2 or newer is required. An alternative module, AWSPowerShell, provides support for older versions of Windows PowerShell and .NET Framework.
This product provides support for all AWS services in a single module. As an alternative, a modular variant is also available: separate smaller modules (e.g. AWS.Tools.EC2, AWS.Tools.S3...) allow managing each AWS Service.
