### Published: 03/04/2025 14:21:11 by ScriptRunner

Provides the ScriptRunner PowerShell host environment variable $SRXEnv for test
and development purposes.

The SRXEnv hash table provides the following keys:

[string] ReportEmail: (3.10.4133.0)
If you have an SMTP server available, the ScriptRunner service can send you email
notifications containing execution reports on error or on success.
Recipient email address (comma-separated list). The full action report will be sent to this address.

[string] ResultEmail: (3.10.4133.0)
Recipient email addresses (comma-separated list). Only the result message will be sent to this address.

[string] ResultHtml: (5.2.6155.0)
The ScriptRunner PowerShell host supports HTML results through the $SRXEnv.ResultHtml variable.
The HTML web page can then be easily retrieved from the ScriptRunner Portal.
For example, you can use the ConvertTo-Html cmdlet to assign HTML to the ResultHTML variable.
You can find a sample script at https://github.com/scriptrunner/ActionPacks under Reporting > _LIB_ > ReportsLibrary.ps1

[ArrayList] ResultList: (4.0.4511.0)
A scripted query must specify this list of string values. The list is associated with
the corresponding action parameter.

[ArrayList] ResultList2: (4.0.4511.0)
A scripted query can specify this optional list of display names. The list appears as
drop-down list for the associated action parameter.

[string] ResultMessage: (3.00.3670.0)
The result message will be displayed in reports and in the immediate result window of the ScriptRunner Portal.

[string] ResultObjectJSON: (4.1.4738.0)
The script can now provide (simple) structured result data by writing a (small) JSON string to $SRXEnv.ResultObjectJSON.
ScriptRunner will provide this JSON string in the OutSerializedPSObjects report field
for post-processing by the caller of the Web Service connector.

[string] SRXActionID: (6.2.577.0)
The ID of the started action. (read-only)

The name of the current action. (read-only)

[string] SRXFilterValue: (6.2.577.0)

from the search filter form in the UI. (read-only)

[string] SRXNodeName: (7.2)

[DateTime] SRXStarted: (4.1.4738.0)
The timestamp of the start of the script execution. (read-only)

[string] SRXStartedBy: (4.1.4738.0)
The user account that requested the execution of the script. (read-only)

[string] SRXStartedIP: (4.1.4738.0)
The IP address of the client that sent the request to execute the script. (read-only)
