### Published: 06/10/2024 00:17:22 by HotCakeX

Harden Windows Safely, Securely, only with Official Microsoft methods

⭕ This module provides 3 main features: Hardening, Auditing/checking the system compliance, and undoing the Hardening

⭕ Please read the GitHub's readme before running this module: https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security

💜 GUI (Graphical User Interface) is Available! Run (Protect-WindowsSecurity -GUI) to use the GUI instead of the CLI experience.

💠 Features of this module:

  ✅ Everything always stays up-to-date with the newest proactive security measures that are industry standards and scalable.
  ✅ Everything is in plain text, nothing hidden, no 3rd party executable or pre-compiled binary is involved.
  ✅ No Windows functionality is removed/disabled against Microsoft's recommendations.
  ✅ The module primarily uses Group policies, the Microsoft recommended way of configuring Windows. It also uses PowerShell cmdlets where Group Policies aren't available, and finally uses a few registry keys to configure security measures that can neither be configured using Group Policies nor PowerShell cmdlets. This is why the module doesn't break anything or cause unwanted behavior.
  ✅ When a hardening measure is no longer necessary because it's applied by default by Microsoft on new builds of Windows, it will also be removed from the module in order to prevent any problems and because it won't be necessary anymore.
  ✅ The module can be run infinite number of times, it's made in a way that it won't make any duplicate changes.
  ✅ The module prompts for confirmation before running each hardening category.
  ✅ Applying these hardening measures makes your PC compliant with Microsoft Security Baselines and Secured-core PC specifications (provided that you use modern hardware that supports the latest Windows security features)

💠 Hardening Categories from top to bottom: (⬇️Detailed info about each of them at my Github⬇️)
