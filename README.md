# PSGallery Reports

![mspowershell](images/PowerShell-transparent-thumb.jpg)

This repository contains reports for the [PowerShell Gallery](https://powershellgallery.com). The hope is that it will be easier for you to find modules that will make your work easier. The plan is to update the reports on a regular basis and push them to this repository.

Feel free to use the Discussion section of this repository to talk about specific modules. If you think there should be another type of report, feel https://github.com/jdhitsolutions/PSGalleryReport/issuesfree to submit a Feature Request in the [Issues](https://github.com/jdhitsolutions/PSGalleryReport/issues) section of this repository.

> :warning: This project is __not__ a PowerShell module for you to install and run yourself. The repository is a location for reports that I am generating and publishing. You are welcome to take the scripts I am using and create your own reports.

## Reports

These are the currently active reports. Reports are created in markdown. I am also converting the markdown documents to PDF files. You might prefer this if you want to create your own automation for downloading the files.

```powershell
Invoke-Webrequest -uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdhitsolutions/PSGalleryReport/main/psgallery-filtered.pdf -outfile d:\temp\psgallery-filtered.pdf
```

Github will render both file types in your browser. Although GitHub will not render links in the PDF versions. But you can download the PDF and view it in your browser.

 You are welcome to clone the repository or download individual reports. In PowerShell 7, you can use `Show-Markdown` to view markdown reports.

```powershell
Show-Markdown .\psgallery-downloads.md -UseBrowser
```

The reports show the same information for each module. The only limiting factor is the report's scope.

### [Latest Published Modules](psgallery-newest.md)

This report will show the most recent 250 modules published to the PowerShell Gallery. The report is sorted by the published date in descending order. The report includes links to the project in the Gallery as well as the project's repository if defined. This list *does not* include any *pre-release* modules.

### [Latest Published Modules (no Azure/AWS)](psgallery-filtered.md)

This report is identical to the previous report except that AWS and Azure modules published by Amazon and Microsoft are __excluded__. There are many of these modules and they could easily consume most of the newest released module report.

### [Latest Published Azure-Related Modules](psgallery-azure.md)

This report gets the last 250 Azure-related modules published to the PowerShell Gallery. These are modules written by Microsoft and the community. The report is sorted by the published date in descending order.

### [Top Downloads](psgallery-downloads.md)

This report is sorted by __total__ download count and limited to the first 250 modules.

### [Top Community Downloads](psgallery-downloads-community.md)

This report is sorted by __total__ download count and limited to the first 250 modules where the author is __not__ Microsoft, Oracle, VMware, Amazon, HP, or Dell. Contributions from the DSC Community are also excluded. Hopefully, this report highlights modules created by individual members of the PowerShell community.

### [Top Authors](psgallery-authors.md)

This is a report of the top 25 module contributors to the PowerShell Gallery. The list *excludes* major vendors such as Microsoft and VMware.  The goal is to highlight individual contributions to the PowerShell Gallery.

### [Tag List](taglist.txt)

This is a simple text list of unique tags found in the PowerShell Gallery. All tags have been converted to lower case, but that should have no affect on using the tag.

```powershell
Find-Module -tag bios
```

:hand: Do not assume this is an authoritative or definitive list. Best efforts have been made to parse tags but tag definitions are not consistent across all published modules.

## A Note on Scripts

I am currently running a daily PowerShell scheduled job locally to generate the reports and upload them to the repository. The general workflow is to get all modules and export the data to a clixml file. I then re-import this data and filter it to generate the reports.

Because I'm using a PowerShell scheduled job, all paths in the script are explictly defined. I'm also using `Write-Host` lines so that I can review the job. Another option I might consider would be to start a transcript.

The script to convert markdown to PDF uses a private set of commands. The commands are Ruby-based and require additional configuration. I am not including them in this repository. If you are using my scripts for your own work, there are VSCode extensions you can use to easily convert markdown files to PDF or you might find other tools for this task.

I am looking into a Github Action to move report generation from my desktop to the cloud.

## Limitations

As of now, there is no way to include *pre-release* modules. You can only use `Find-Module` to search for pre-release when using the module name. You can always click the PowerShell Gallery link in a report and check for pre-release versions.
